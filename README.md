2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

- Out of the 72,458 employees ready to retired there are only 1,549 employees ready tp take on a mentorship program.
- This mentorship program should get these 1,549 employees ready to take on new task and train the upcoming new hires that are ahead.
- Theses ready for mentorship employyes should get ready to train the upcoming new generation.
- This new generations should replace the coming retirements.
- Among this new generation Pewlett-Hackard should try to hire talent and poeple with management skills in order to facilitate transition.
- Out of all retiring employees there are only two that are i a manager position, Pewlett-Hackard should hire or trin their new replacement before they leave, since this posiiton reuieres more experience. 
- Pewlett-Hackard should already start looking for new Senior Engineers and Senior Staff because they represent the mayprity of retireing employees, and this process will take time, and the better they are prepare the best. Being over staff with this titles will prevent possible catastrophies down the road.
